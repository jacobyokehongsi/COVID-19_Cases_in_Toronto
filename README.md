## Effects of Demographics and Geography of COVID-19 Cases in Toronto

# Paper Overview
This repository contains a paper that conducts data exploration on age groups and neighbourhoods in Toronto that were most affected by COVID-19. Using the COVID-19 Cases in Toronto data from City of Toronto Open Portal, I determined the number of covid cases with respect to age groups and neighbourhoods. In my paper, I determined that age groups between 20 to 29 years old, as well as the Woburn neighbourhood to have the highest covid cases. Thus, with the data, we could target the specific population in order to curb the effects of covid by implementing tighter restrictions and setting up more vaccine clinics at the locations.
